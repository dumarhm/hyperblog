            This is my first work about Git and GitHub
            Welcome to my first blogpost on Git and GitHub repositories

        <div id="container">

                Hyperblog
                <span id="tagline">
                    This is the HEAD blogpost
                </span>
                <p>
                    Suscribe and thumbs up
                </p>

                    I thought I had written something
                    in here.
                    But it seems I was wrong
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="post">
                <h1>
                    This is an attractive title and
                    also interesting
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This is the starting paragraph where
                    amazing things will be explained
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the mos significant change
                    you will ever see in this part of
                    the blogpost, because it all means 
                    the starting point towards the use
                    of the merge command
                </p>
